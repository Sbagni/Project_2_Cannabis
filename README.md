**Canadian Cannabis Companies**

The aim of this project was to create a visualisation about current financial growth of top 10 Canadian Cannabis Companies. 
There were not a lot of datasets available for these comapanies since they are still in their nascent stage. It began with extracting the datasets. Infact,like any other ETL project we created the dataset for this analysis.

We used each company's balance sheet to extract the data. There was a lot of information, however, we focussed on some of the key factors like profit, loss, current assets, liabilities, COGS (cost of goods sold), goodwill etc.

Python was used to transform the data. It helped us to generate and clean the datasets.



**Libraries used for visualisation**

Plotly, NVD3 and Leaflet

We used NVD3 to create this interactive graph.

Leaflet was used  for this visualisation of various companies on the map. The size of the purple circle is based on their 
respective sales.
